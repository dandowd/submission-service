# Application
This is the backend to support a multi step form for a user registration/application. It does not require a user to create an account or login.

This service would manage a user while the "submission" is not fully complete. Once it is complete it would become an official "application". This service should be improved by adding a caching strategy so that a user isn't required to wait for DB operations.

## TODO: go into more detail about the decisions that were made
